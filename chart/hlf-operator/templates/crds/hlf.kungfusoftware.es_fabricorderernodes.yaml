                    not apply to all instances of a given Kind. \n Conditions should

                    care about rather than requiring those properties to be inferred
                    from other observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition
                    can not be changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and
                    has the same backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of
                    any other part of the API."
